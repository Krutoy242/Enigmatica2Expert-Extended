    >
    > While Stock Trader villager was a nice complement to sheer scope of Numishaul, its trading efficiency was somewhat disappointing, rarely yielding more than 2x power in sold coins.
    > 
    > - significantly increased RF profit from each trade, increasing the average power bonus from 1.5x to 3x!  
    > - level 1 is now effectively old level 2, trading emeralds for t1 alloy coins  
    > - level 2 now trades t2 and t3 alloys for varied price of 2-3 emerald instead of 1 emerald  
    > - level 3, 4 and 6 have been restructured to incorporate coins from previous levels of trading  
    > - level 5 now uses t3 and t4 alloys instead of t0 and t1
