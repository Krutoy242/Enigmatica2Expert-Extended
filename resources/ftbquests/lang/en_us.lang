bq.quest430.name=Basic Circuits
bq.quest430.desc=Basic Circuits are an essential crafting component made using the Crystallizer, Cutting Machine and Precision Assembler. They're not the only component that requires this processing chain, but they're the most used ones.\n\nTo make a Basic Circuit, first make some Silicon in your Electric Arc Furnace, turn it into a Silicon Boule in the Crystallizer, cut it into Silicon Wafers using the Cutting Machine, assemble them with the required components in the Precision Assembler, and finally cut the result in the Cutting Machine.

bq.quest437.name=Rocket Assembling Machine
bq.quest437.desc=The Rocket Assembling Machine is a multiblock structure that will allow you to make Rockets to go into space. This first quest will only detail how to build the structure.\n\nStart by placing Launch Pad blocks in a rectangle on the ground. It can be anywhere from 3x3 to 16x16. On the same level, place a Structure Tower near one of the side, then stack up more of them to make a 1 block tower. This tower can be anywhere from 4 to 64 blocks tall.\n\nFinally, place the Rocket Assembling Machine itself one block above the level of the Pads, with the back of the machine facing the Pad, and plug it with RF. If you did this correctly, it should no longer say "Invalid Launch Pad Structure".\n\nThen you need the Fueling Station to be able to fuel your Rockets. Place it somewhere near the Assembling Machine, plug it with RF and your source of Rocket Fuel, then sneak + right click it with a Linker, then sneak + right click the Assembling Machine with the same Linker.
bq.quest438.name=Building a Rocket
bq.quest438.desc=Building a Rocket is the last step before getting to space.\n\nThe Rocket needs to be built on your Rocket Assembling Machine, with the Launch Pad blocks delimiting the horizontal space you have and the Structure Tower the vertical space you have (you can't go higher than your stack of Structure Towers and can't go out the rectangle of Launch Pad).\n\nA manned Rocket needs a Guidance Computer, a Seat, at least one Rocket Engine (a better version can be crafted once you got Titanium Iridium Alloy) and at least one Liquid Fuel Tank. There are no other restrictions that apply, your Rocket can be as unrealistic as you want so long that you respect the above points.\n\nTo check if your Rocket is actually capable of reaching space, go on your Rocket Assembling Machine and click Scan. It will both tell you how what's missing as well as various stats, as follow :\n-Thrust : how much thrust the Engines are providing\n-Weight : how heavy is the Rocket, most blocks have the same weight but blocks with inventories can be heavier\n-Fuel : how much fuel capacity you have, increased by adding more Tanks; the white line is the amount required to reach orbit, and thus you should always have more than that\n-Acceleration : how fast will the Rocket accelerate on a planet with as much gravity as the Overworld; white bar in the middle is 0 m/s² so you should always be higher than that\n\nWhen your Rocket is ready, click Build on the Rocket Assembling Machine. You can then right click to board it or sneak + right click to open its inventories and check the fuel level.\n\nFinally, insert your Planet Id Chip in the Guidance Computer's inventory, then in the Rocket's inventory click Select Dst, select Luna either on the map or through the Planet List, and click Select.\n\nMake sure you have a full Space Suit (or full armor enchanted with Airtight Seal) filled with Oxygen, then board the Rocket and press Space. You will then arrive on Luna. To go back, select Earth like you selected Luna earlier, board the Rocket and take off again. You don't need as much fuel to take off from Luna.

bq.quest440.desc=The Space Station Assembler is used to assemble Space Stations.\n\nYou will need the same setup as for building Rockets, the only differences being Space Stations don't need fuel, and when they're built, they compress into item form.\n\nThe item then needs to be launched into space, with a rocket with a Satellite Bay. The rocket will be lost, unless you give it a Guidance Computer with the Space Station ID Chip in it, in which case it'll land on the newly made Space Station.\n\nYou can travel there by making a Rocket, and placing the Space Station ID Chip in the Guidance Computer.§4 Make sure to always have backups of your Space Station ID Chip!
