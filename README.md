**Enigmatica 2: Expert - Extended** is unofficial continuation of [Enigmatica 2: Expert](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica2expert)

The aim of the addon is to make `E2E` even **more interesting** and **challenging**. Balance it out as much as possible, but leave the most interesting stuff untouched.

## Mods

Here are `+200` up-to-date 1.12.2 mods (about 400 total).  
Despite this, the modpack **only takes 30% longer** to load than the original E2E. And the **FPS** in the game is **even higher**.

10+ additional major mods and +200 tweaking and Quality of Life addons. Some notable of them:

## Principles

- ### No OP items. No exploits. Less cheese  

  No item should disable bunch of other items.  
  Work towards crafting the powerful items, or use less powerful alternatives.  
  *![](https://git.io/JOv9z "Angel Ring") The Angel Ring is harder to give way to all other flight options.*  
  *![](https://git.io/JOv92 "Terrasteel") Сan no longer be easily cheesed through the mob stripping farm..*

- ### Tinker's Hegemony  

  Material balance was reworked, OP traits remapped. Mobs spawn with random TCon's weapons.  
  *![](https://git.io/JGncx "Osgloglas") Is no longer the only correct option.*

- ### More adventuring  

  Better caves, additional structures, more loot, reworked planets.  
  *![](https://git.io/Jze1z "Rocket Assembling Machine") Added a variety of new resources and unique terrain on planets and other dimensions.*

- ### Less void miners -> more processing  

  *![](https://git.io/JOv90 "Sieve") Reworked. New x7 ore processing line comes in.*

- ### Clear guide  

  Quests and recipes reveal unpopular "hidden" mechanics  
  *![](https://git.io/JtJMc "Book") More Quest chapters describing "forgotten" items*

- ### Less Strict  

  Tedious recipes and whole branches of mods **can be skipped** with alternate recipes.  
  **Exploration is optional** - you can finish the modpack without even going into Twilight Forest.  
  *![](https://is.gd/tWaivc "Gaia Spirit") You don't want to sweat killing the Gaia Guardian? Just skip it.*

## Installation

### ⚠️ Update your Java

To play this pack you **must** update your Java from verson `1.8.0_51` to newer one.

You can check out your current Java version in F3 menu or on 5th line of file `logs/latest.log`.

### From Curse Forge

Just use *New Instance* feature of your launcher. [GDLauncher example](https://i.imgur.com/1KV7r6T.png).

### Manual installation

1. Download `E2E-Extended_{version}.zip` from Assets of [latest release](https://github.com/Krutoy242/Enigmatica2Expert-Extended/releases) *OR* from [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica-2-expert-extended).
2. Use *Import* feature in your launcher.

### Skyblock 🌌

In Skyblock mode, you cannot leave the starting Void dimension (with a couple of exceptions).

In order to create a new Skyblock world, you need:

1. In main menu go to `Mods` => `Just Enough Dimensions` Config => `Generic` => `initialSpawnDimensionId` set to `3`
2. Then `Create New World` => `Create New World`

If you play on a server on which have already made these changes, the client does not need to change the configs.

## Recommended mods

- [**Entity Culling**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-culling) - increase performance, but can cause crashes on some machines

- [**Dynamic Surroundings**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-surroundings) - better sounds and environmental, but increaing load time and lower FPS a bit

-----------------

## Developing strategy

This is unofficial addon and not supported with **Enigmatica** dev team.

Some of the changes from the `Extended` version [[1]](https://github.com/EnigmaticaModpacks/Enigmatica2Expert/pull/1926)[[2]](https://github.com/EnigmaticaModpacks/Enigmatica2Expert/pull/1773)[[3]](https://github.com/EnigmaticaModpacks/Enigmatica2Expert/pull/1577) were added to the main modpack as well, so I became a [contributor](https://github.com/EnigmaticaModpacks/Enigmatica2Expert/graphs/contributors).
